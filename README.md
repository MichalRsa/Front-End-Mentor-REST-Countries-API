This app is one of the challenges from [`Frontend Mentor`](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca). It's a static single page application, built with [`Creat React App`](https://create-react-app.dev/) and [`React router`](https://reactrouter.com/). For styles it uses CSS [`Modules`](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) with [`SCSS`](https://sass-lang.com/) syntax
